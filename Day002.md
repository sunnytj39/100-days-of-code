# React Native, Redux, Security

## Higher-Order Components(HOC)
HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
HOCs are common in third-party React libraries, such as Redux's `connect`

## React Navigation(Stack Navigator)
`createStackNavigator` provides a way for your app to transition between screens where each new screen is placed on top of a stack

## Cross Site Scripting(XSS)
XSS is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications.
XSS enables attackers to inject client-side script into web pages viewed by other users.

### Types
- Reflected (non-persistent)
- Persistent (or stored)
- Server-side versus DOM-based vulnerabilities
- Self-XSS
- Mutated XSS

### Preventive measures
- Contextual output encoding/escaping of string input
- Safely validating untrusted HTML input
- Cookie security
- Disabling scripts
- Emerging defensive technologies
- SameSite cookie parameter
