# Accessibility in React

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

WCAG provides guidelines for creating accessible websites.

Web accessibility is the design and creation of websites that can be used by everyome.

Accessibility support is necessary to allow assistive technology to interpret web pages.

## Fragment

Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessibility in a web application.

Sometimes we break HTML semantics when we add `<div>` elements to our JSX to make our React code work, especially when working with lists and the `<table>`.

In these cases we should rather user React Fragments to group together multiple elements.

## Programmatically managing focus

Sometimes leading to keyboard focus being lost or set tot an unexpected element.

In order repair to this, we need to programmatically nudge the keyboard focus in the right diretion.

To set focus in React, we can use Refs to DOM elements.

When a parent component need to set focus to an element in a child component, We can do this by exposing DOM refs to parent components through a special prop on the child component.

## Forwarding Refs

Ref forwarding is a technique for automatically passing a `ref` through a component to one of its children.

It can be useful for some kinds of components, especially in reusable component libraries.

When using a HOC to extend components, it's recommended to forward the ref to the wrapped component.
