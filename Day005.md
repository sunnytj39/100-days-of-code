# React Native

## Style

Components are using the flexbox algorithm in React Native. 

`flexDirection` defaulting to `column` instead of `row`, and the `flex` parameter only supporting a single number.

If a parent does not have either a fixed `width` and `height` or `flex`, the parent will have dimensions of 0 and the `flex` children will not visible.

## AsyncStorage

It is a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app.

I use `react-native-storage`. this is a local storage wrapper for AsyncStorage

## WebView
