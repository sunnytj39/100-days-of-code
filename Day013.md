## Push Notifications

We started implementing Push Notifications.

We wanna to use FCM in our app, but it seems to that FCM cannot be used to send messages to the Android Expo Client. Also, FCM is not currently available for Expo iOS apps.

So we implemented by Expo Push Notifications, do we have to eject our app to use FCM...?
