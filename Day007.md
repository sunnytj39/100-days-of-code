Parent of WebView passes itself as a prop to the WebView.

This props allows its own functions to be called directly from the WebView to respond to events.

## Handling Touches

`Button` provides a basic button component that is rendered nicely on all platforms.

If the basic button doesn't look right for your app, you can build your own button using any of the "Touchable" components.

The "Touchable" components provides the capability to capture tapping gestures, and can display feedback when a gesture is recognized.

- TouchableHighlight

- TouchableNativeFeedback

- TouchableOpacity

- TouchableWithoutFeedback
