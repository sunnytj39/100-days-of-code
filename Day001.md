# Introduced redux-saga

[redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/blob/master/README_ja.md)

## Effects
I used 4 effects

### fork(fn, ...args)
Perform anon-blocking call on `fn`

### take(pattern)
Wait for a specified action on the Store.
The Generator is suspended until an action that matches `pattern` is dispatched.

### put(action)
Dispatch an `action` to the Store.
This effects non-blocking.

### call(fn, ...args)
Call the function `fn` with `args`
